# Miniscript

Library for handling [Miniscript](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/),
which is a subset of Elements Script designed to support simple and general
tooling. Miniscripts represent threshold circuits of spending conditions,
and can therefore be easily visualized or serialized as human-readable
strings.
